# SegViT-YOSO

Ongoing work on segmentation using Vision Transformers combined with YOSO architecture.

## Introduction

The project aims to train a dot in a 2D environment to avoid obstacles using Reinforcement Learning (RL) and a Vision Transformer (ViT). The 2D environment is constructed using pygame, and the RL and ViT components are built with PyTorch. The goal of the project is to generate a combination of Vision Transformers (ViT) and the YOSO (You Only Segment Once) architecture for better performance. 

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
2. Navigate to the project directory: 
3. Install the required dependencies:
> Note: You might want to consider creating a virtual environment for the project.

4. Download the COCO dataset and place it under the `datasets/` directory.
